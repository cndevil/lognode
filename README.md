# lognode
An Service to store logs efficiently. 

We will be having api key exposed like server1 --> log server ( will get corresponding server & store log in its table )
each new server we add logger will create new table in db, this make sure logs are mangaed seprately for servers.

This is very basic but can be made into sass
